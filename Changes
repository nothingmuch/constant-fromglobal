Revision history for perl module Constant::FromGlobal

    - Added leading _ to names of internal functions,
      to hide them from pod coverage.

0.09 2016-08-08 NEILB
    - Added a link to Adam Kennedy's original blog post on use.perl.org,

      the original URL can be mapped to something which works.

0.07 2014-10-12 NEILB
    - Added new testsuites that cover all the types of constraints / coercions
